## Features
- Shows accuracy on highscores in the level select menu
- Shows accuracy, letter score, and personal best while playing a track
- Shows accuracy on end screen
- Accuracy Types:
  - Base Game
    - Uses the internal calculations for the letter where >100% = S
  - Real
    - Calculates the actual maximum score for a track, here an S â‰ˆ 60%
    - A 100% on this is practically impossible just because of how the game calculates scores
  - Decreasing: Uses real accuracy, but your % will always decrease or stay the same.
    - For example, ignoring multipliers, completely missing the first note of a 100 note song will give you 99%.
  - Increasing: Uses real accuracy, but your % will always increase or stay the same.
    - For example, ignoring multipliers, perfectly hitting the first note of a 100 note song will give you 1%.
- Most of the features can be enabled/disabled in the settings
