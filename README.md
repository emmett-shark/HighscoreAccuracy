## Features

- Shows accuracy when playing a track
- Show personal best while playing a track

- Accuracy Types:
  - Base Game
    - Uses the internal calculations for the letter where >100% = S
  - Real
    - Calculates the actual maximum score for a track, here an S ≈ 60%
    - A 100% on this is practically impossible just because of how the game calculates scores
- Most of the features can be enabled/disabled in the settings
